DappGram: fluxograms for Neo Dapps

Thanks to @Shargon devil mind, I suddently have another project... hope that starts and finishes quickly such as neo-smacco :)

The idea is to provide fluxogram diagram for Neo Dapps. This allows public drawing of fluxograms for Neo AVM.

This project is publicly available at https://neoresearch.io/dappgram-web

If you are looking for neo-dappgram source-code, take a look at: github.com/neoresearch/neo-dappgram

## ideas

Opcodes can be parsed using neocompiler-eco libs, and opcodes may be grouped into "structured opcodes", which are opcodes(and,its,parameters). Parameter sequence will follow stack sequence, from left to right (left is first top, second left is second top, ...).
